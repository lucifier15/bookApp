## Tools and Technologies

**Reactjs**

React is a front-end library developed by Facebook. It is used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components. It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and has a strong foundation and large community behind it.

**Webpack**

Webpack is a **module bundler**. Webpack can take care of bundling alongside a separate task runner. However, the line between bundler and task runner has become blurred thanks to community developed webpack plugins. Sometimes these plugins are used to perform tasks that are usually done outside of webpack, such as cleaning the build directory or deploying the build.

**Babel**

**Babel** is a **JavaScript** transpiler that converts edge **JavaScript** into plain old ES5**JavaScript** that can run in any browser (even the old ones). It makes available all the syntactical sugar that was added to **JavaScript** with the new **ES6** specification, including classes, fat arrows and multiline strings.
